        help
            Stack size for the single HMI coordinator task that processes
            all commands sequentially (line handling, file I/O, display
            updates). Must be large enough for the deepest call chain
            (typically program load with graph building).

    config NEXTION_COORDINATOR_TASK_PRIORITY
        int "Coordinator task priority"
        default 5

    config NEXTION_COORDINATOR_QUEUE_DEPTH
        int "Command queue depth"
        default 8
        help
            Maximum number of commands that can be queued before the
            coordinator processes them. Commands arrive at human
            interaction speed, so a small queue is sufficient.
